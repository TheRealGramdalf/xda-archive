Welcome to the xda-archive! 

# What is this place? 

In the process of trying to install custom roms on some of my personal devices, I found that it was hard to find the correct files. I figured it would be a good idea to host a github repository which can be an archive for any forum posts/binaries/apps and things related to rooting in general.

# Why do I need this?

Finding files from various threads isn't always possible, as the hosting service may not be up anymore, the account it was uploaded with has been deleted, etc. This is mainly for the purpose of preserving these items so that they are in one, centralized place.
